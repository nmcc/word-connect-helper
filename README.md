# Word Connect helper

[Word Connect](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/word-connect-%C2%A4/id1226926872) is a puzzle game 
where users are presented with a set of letters for which they have to build words with.

This program provides a user interface to find solutions for the puzzles.

There are several websites that provide this functionality, but building it one from scratch is way more fun, isn't it?
 
> IMPORTANT NOTE:
>
> This is still under development.
> The plan is to build a WebAPI that loads the English dictionary and provides
> solutions and then build a simple web site to make it more user-friendly
